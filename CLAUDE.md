# BASICS
Begin by reading the README.md file to understand the project structure and organization.
Make sure to update the README.md file whenever making substantial changes to structure or organization.


# Coding Instructions
- Prefer using library functions for common things like matrix multiplication,
  data structure manipulation, etc. Add new libraries to the importmap section in index.html.
- Write clean code with comments and organized into logical blocks, using helper functions
  where necessary. Avoid giant hard-to-understand function blocks with magic numbers.
