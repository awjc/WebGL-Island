# First Iteration - Island Display

## What Was Implemented

This is the foundational iteration that gets a simple 3D island rendered with interactive camera controls.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **client/index.html** - Updated
   - Simplified to remove old control panel
   - Added FPS counter element
   - Changed title to "WebGL Island"

2. **client/src/rendering/Terrain.js** - Created
   - Simple circular island using `THREE.CircleGeometry`
   - Grass-green material (color: #4a7c59)
   - 50 units radius
   - Rotated to lie flat on XZ plane
   - Receives shadows

3. **client/src/renderer.js** - Enhanced
   - Added `OrbitControls` for mouse camera movement
   - Changed background to sky blue (#87CEEB)
   - Positioned camera at (0, 50, 50) looking down at island
   - Added ambient light for overall illumination
   - Added directional light with shadows
   - Configured shadow mapping
   - Added `addMesh()` and `removeMesh()` helper methods

4. **client/src/main.js** - Updated
   - Imports and initializes `Terrain` class
   - Adds terrain mesh to renderer scene
   - Maintains existing FPS counter functionality

5. **README.md** - Updated
   - Reflected new project structure
   - Added references to planning documents

## Features Working

✅ **3D Island Rendering**
- Circular green island at center of scene
- Proper lighting with ambient + directional lights
- Shadow casting enabled (ready for future entities)

✅ **Camera Controls**
- Left mouse drag: Rotate around island
- Right mouse drag: Pan camera
- Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out
- Camera stays above ground (can't go below horizon)
- Min distance: 20 units, Max distance: 150 units
- Smooth damping for natural feel

✅ **Performance**
- FPS counter in top-right corner
- Smooth 60fps on modern hardware

✅ **Visual Quality**
- Anti-aliasing enabled
- Sky blue background
- Soft shadows
- Standard PBR materials

## How to Test

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   python server.py
   ```

2. Open browser to `http://localhost:8080`

3. You should see:
   - A green circular island in the center
   - Sky blue background
   - FPS counter in top-right corner

4. Test camera controls:
   - Click and drag to orbit around island
   - Right-click drag to pan
   - Scroll to zoom
   - Camera should feel smooth and natural

## Next Steps (Not Implemented Yet)

Following the MVP_PLAN.md, the next iterations would add:

- **Iteration 2**: Basic entities (Food and Creature classes)
- **Iteration 3**: Simple wandering behavior
- **Iteration 4**: Hunger system and food seeking
- **Iteration 5**: UI control panel with spawn buttons
- **Iteration 6**: Population stats and simulation management

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **File Organization**: Following MVP_PLAN structure with `src/rendering/` folder
2. **Three.js Version**: Using 0.170.0 from CDN
3. **Module System**: ES6 modules with importmap
4. **Camera Position**: Isometric-ish view from above provides good overview of island

### Known Limitations

- No terrain variation yet (flat circle)
- No water around island
- No ambient effects (particles, etc.)
- Shadows work but no entities to cast them yet

### Performance Considerations

- Simple geometry keeps rendering fast
- Shadow map resolution set to 2048x2048 (good quality without performance hit)
- Single mesh, single material (very efficient)

## Code Quality

- Added JSDoc comments to main functions
- Clean separation: Renderer manages Three.js, Terrain creates geometry
- Easy to extend: `addMesh()` method ready for entities
- No hardcoded magic numbers in critical paths

**Status**: ✅ Ready for review and iteration 2
**Estimated Time**: ~1 hour
**LOC Added**: ~150 lines
