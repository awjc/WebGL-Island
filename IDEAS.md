## Core Evolution Features

### Creature Reproduction & Genetics
- **Basic Reproduction System**
  - Creatures spawn offspring when energy exceeds a reproduction threshold
  - Energy cost for reproduction (parent loses energy to create offspring)
  - Cooldown period between reproduction cycles
  - Offspring inherit traits from parent(s)

- **Genetic System**
  - DNA encoding for heritable traits (speed, perception, hunger thresholds, etc.)
  - Mutation rate for trait variations between generations
  - Multiple genes controlling different aspects of creature behavior
  - Track generational lineage and family trees

- **Evolution Metrics**
  - Average trait values over time
  - Fitness tracking (lifespan, offspring count)
  - Evolutionary pressure based on food scarcity
  - Generational statistics and graphs

### Phenotypical Expression & Visual Variation
- **Visual Distinctiveness**
  - Color variations based on genetic traits
  - Size/scale variations reflecting genetic fitness
  - Shape variations (different geometries for different "species")
  - Visual markers for different genetic lineages
  - Age-based appearance changes (babies vs adults)

- **Behavioral Mutations**
  - Speed variations (fast vs slow creatures)
  - Perception range differences (better/worse "eyesight")
  - Energy efficiency mutations (metabolic rate variations)
  - Aggression levels (territorial behavior)
  - Social behavior (pack hunting, flocking)
  - Risk-taking vs cautious behavior patterns

### Multi-Level Ecosystem (Predator/Prey)
- **Carnivore Creatures**
  - New species that hunts herbivores instead of eating food
  - Different AI state machine (hunting, stalking, chasing)
  - Pack hunting behavior for coordinated attacks
  - Energy gain from consuming other creatures

- **Predator-Prey Dynamics**
  - Population balance mechanisms
  - Fear/flee behavior for herbivores when predators nearby
  - Predator starvation when prey is scarce
  - Coevolution of predator speed vs prey speed
  - Camouflage and stealth mechanics

- **Food Chain Complexity**
  - Scavenger species that eat dead creatures
  - Omnivores that can eat both plants and creatures
  - Energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels
  - Population cycles (predator-prey oscillations)
